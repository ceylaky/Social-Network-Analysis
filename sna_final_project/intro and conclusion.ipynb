    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph that our team chose for this project is the “Friends” TV series. It is weighted and undirected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of the project is to analyze the social dynamics of characters of famous TVseries \"Friends\" using the acquired knowledge of social networking. To achieve it, we were provided with the text file that contained the dataset of character interactions throughout the whole show. Each node represents a node and interactions between them are classified as edges. We used these resources to understand the relationships between characters and identify patterns, trends in their interactions, using various networking analysis techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project itself covers a diverse amount of aspects of social networking analysis. Starting from basic metrics, like average degree and network density, and diving deeper into more advanced concepts, like centrality measures and community detection. Additionally, we explore various local and global network properties, such as clustering and the overall network structure, which offer deeper insights into how characters influence each other’s behaviors and decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing social networks between characters, we can get valuable insights into their influence and relationships. It is also important to mention that most of the outputs that were created in frames of this project, are being visualized for the purpose of getting a clearer picture of how the characters' relationships shape the social fabric of the Friends universe. The findings from this project can offer insights into how social networks function in real life, as well as how media portrays group interactions and relationships.\n"

    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project gave us a deeper look into the social dynamics of the characters from Friends by applying social network analysis techniques. We started with a graph of 747 characters and 1610 interactions between them, which allowed us to examine how these characters are connected throughout the show. The average degree of 4.31 suggests that each character interacts with about four others, while the network's low density (0.0058) indicates that, although there are many interactions, they represent only a small portion of all possible connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also explored the graph’s average clustering and transitivity, which showed that the relationships between characters are not very tightly connected. Joey turned out to be the most central character based on closeness centrality, meaning he has relatively quick access to other characters in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project then moved into link prediction, where we used several measures like Common Neighbors, Jaccard Index, and Adamic-Adar to predict potential new connections between characters. One of the most surprising results was the high likelihood of interaction between Joey and Joshua, even though they never really interacted in the show. This highlights how network science can uncover hidden connections and give us fresh insights into how characters are related, beyond what’s immediately apparent on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project not only enhanced our understanding of the interpersonal dynamics among the characters of Friends, but also highlighted the applicability of social network analysis in uncovering complex patterns and relationships within both fictional and real-world social structures.\n"
